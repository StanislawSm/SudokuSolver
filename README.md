# SudokuSolver

This repo include project made for AI subject at university. I've made it with two colleagues. Our task was to compare four Sudoku solving algorithms.
In my part I implemented and trained neural network to solve this particular problem. Mine secound task was to compare times which all four algorithm needed to solve few Sudoku riddles.

All project is written in Python. I used Keras library to work with neural network. Riddles with answers ware taken from Kaggle. Results was shown by using matPlotLib.
